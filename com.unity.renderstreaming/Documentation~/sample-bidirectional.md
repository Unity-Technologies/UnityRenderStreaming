# Bidirectional Sample

This is a sample of bi-directional(send/receive) each other's video.

It works with Unity-Unity or Unity-Browser combination.

> [!NOTE]
> If no codec is available on both sender and receiver, the video can not stream. Please note that the compatibility of codecs is different corresponding to platforms and graphics API.

## Usage

### Hardware acceleration 

Recommend enabling `Hardware Encoder support` on the `Render Streaming` inspector to improve performance using hardware acceleration.

### Procedure (Unity-Unity)

1) Launch the signaling server using private mode. Please refer to [this link](webapp.md) for launching.

> [!NOTE]
> This sample does not work on signaling server in public mode.

2) Open `Bidirectional` scene and specify IP address of the signaling server to the `Signaling URL` parameter on the inspector.

3) If you need, change the `Device Index` parameter on `WebCamStreamer` component.

> [!NOTE]
> When building application for iOS platform, you need set `Camera Usage Description` on Player Settings.
> If not set this, your application exits. (refer [this page](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW24))
