# About Unity Render Streaming

Use the &lt;package name&gt; package to &lt;list of the main uses for the package&gt;. For example, use &lt;package name&gt; to create/generate/extend/capture &lt;mention major use case, or a good example of what the package can be used for&gt;. The &lt;package name&gt; package also includes &lt;other relevant features or uses&gt;.

# Using Unity Render Streaming
For packages that augment the Unity Editor with additional features, this section should include workflow and/or reference documentation:

* At a minimum, this section should include reference documentation that describes the windows, editors, and properties that the package adds to Unity. This reference documentation should include screen grabs (see how to add screens below), a list of settings, an explanation of what each setting does, and the default values of each setting.
* Ideally, this section should also include a workflow: a list of steps that the user can easily follow that demonstrates how to use the feature. This list of steps should include screen grabs (see how to add screens below) to better describe how to use the feature.

For packages that include sample files, this section may include detailed information on how the user can use these sample files in their projects and scenes. However, workflow diagrams or illustrations could be included if deemed appropriate.

## How to add images

If the [Using &lt;package name&gt;](#UsingPackageName) section includes screen grabs or diagrams, a link to the image must be added to this MD file, before or after the paragraph with the instruction or description that references the image. In addition, a caption should be added to the image link that includes the name of the screen or diagram. All images must be PNG files with underscores for spaces. No animated GIFs.

An example is included below:

![A cinematic in the Timeline Editor window.](images/example.png)

Notice that the example screen shot is included in the images folder. All screen grabs and/or diagrams must be added and referenced from the images folder.
