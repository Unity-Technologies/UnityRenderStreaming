# Using with Input System

Unity Render Streaming supports controlling device input using [Input System](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.inputsystem@latest). Input from a browser or Unity can be reflected to Unity on another PC.

The user input on the browser is converted to the message format of Input System and sent messages to another peers. The receiver of input message supports both Unity and the browser without having to implement any additional functionality.

## Preferences

You need to configure settings described below to use Input System. Note that different versions of Unity Editor support different methods.
