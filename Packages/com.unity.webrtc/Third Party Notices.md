      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as described therein. The MIT
license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories, is
compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.

The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
openssl-core@openssl.org.

The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
record keeping.)

The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is
described in clear, concise terms at:

The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the
minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice
and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever
license you like.

libjpeg-turbo Licenses
======================

libjpeg-turbo is covered by three compatible BSD-style open source licenses:

- The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
  [README.ijg](README.ijg)

  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs
  (any code inherited from libjpeg, and any modifications to that code.)

- The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed in
  [turbojpeg.c](turbojpeg.c)

  This license covers the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs.

- The zlib License, which is listed in [simd/jsimdext.inc](simd/jsimdext.inc)

  This license is a subset of the other two, and it covers the libjpeg-turbo
  SIMD extensions.


Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
=========================================

This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
best of our understanding.

1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
    then:

    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
        from the source.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
        - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
        - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
        file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if
        there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
        simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
        - Clause 2 of the zlib License

    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
        copyright or license text in that file.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License

2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
    if you are distributing an application that statically links with
    libjpeg-turbo, then:

    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

        This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
        Group.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 2 of the IJG license

    2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
        your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
        License.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
    contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

    **Origin**
    - IJG License
    - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
    free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
    consequences resulting from your use of the software.

    **Origin**
    - IJG License
    - Modified BSD License
    - zlib License


The Modified (3-clause) BSD License
===================================

Copyright (C)<YEAR> <AUTHOR>.  All Rights Reserved.

Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

- Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice,
  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.
- Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.
- Neither the name of the libjpeg-turbo Project nor the names of its
  contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
  software without specific prior written permission.

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS 'AS IS',
AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
ARE DISCLAIMED.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS OR CONTRIBUTORS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF
SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS
INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.


The zlib License
================

Copyright (C) <YEAR>, <AUTHOR>.

This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
warranty.  In no event will the authors be held liable for any damages
arising from the use of this software.

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
freely, subject to the following restrictions:

1. The origin of this software must not be misrepresented; you must not
   claim that you wrote the original software. If you use this software
   in a product, an acknowledgment in the product documentation would be
   appreciated but is not required.
2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be
   misrepresented as being the original software.
3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution.


Why Three Licenses?
===================

The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.

NVIDIA VIDEO CODEC SDK LICENSE AGREEMENT (“Agreement”)

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE SOFTWARE AND OTHER AVAILABLE MATERIALS,
YOU (“LICENSEE”) AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT.  If Licensee does not agree to the terms and condition of this
Agreement, THEN do not downLOAD, INSTALL OR USE the SOFTWARE AND MATERIALS.

The materials available for download to Licensees may include software in both
sample source code ("Source Code") and object code ("Object Code") versions
(collectively, the “Software”), documentation and other materials
(collectively, these code and materials referred to herein as "Licensed
Materials").  Except as expressly indicated herein, all terms and conditions of
this Agreement apply to all of the Licensed Materials.

Except as expressly set forth herein, NVIDIA owns all of the Licensed Materials
and makes them available to Licensee only under the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.

License:  Subject to Licensee’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement,
NVIDIA grants to Licensee a nonexclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,
royalty-free, fully paid-up license and right to install, use, reproduce,
display, perform, modify the Source Code of the Software, and to prepare and
have prepared derivative works thereof, and distribute the Software and
derivative works thereof (in object code only) as integrated in Licensee
software products solely for use with supported NVIDIA GPU hardware products as
specified in the accompanying release notes.  The following terms apply to the
Licensed Material:

Derivative Works:  Subject to the License Grant Back below, Licensee shall own
any Derivative Works it creates directly to the Source Code that integrates
with Licensee’s software product ("Modification(s)") subject to NVIDIA’s
ownership of the underlying Source Code and all intellectual property rights
therein. 

Distribution: Licensee may distribute the Software (in object code form)
integrated with Licensee software products only to Licensee’s authorized
distributors, resellers, and others in Licensee’s distribution chain for
Licensee product and end users and grant to such third party a sublicense to
use the Software under a written, legally enforceable agreement that has the
effect of protecting the Software and the rights of NVIDIA under terms no less
restrictive than this Agreement.

Limitations: Unless otherwise authorized in the Agreement, Licensee shall not
otherwise assign, sublicense, lease, or in any other way transfer or disclose
Software to any third party. Licensee agrees not to disassemble, decompile or
reverse engineer the Object Code or use or modify any of the Licensed Materials
to enable screen scraping, data scraping, or any other activity with the
purpose of capturing copyright protected content in violation of a third party
party’s intellectual property or other proprietary rights.  Licensee shall
indemnify NVIDIA for any and all claims, liabilities, damages, expenses and
costs arising from Licensee’s breach of the foregoing limitations. 

License Grant Back:Licensee hereby grants to NVIDIA and its affiliates a
worldwide, non-exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual, sublicenseable (through
multiple tiers of sublicensees), royalty-free and fully paid-up right and
license to the Modification(s) created by or on behalf of Licensee so that
NVIDIA may copy, modify, create derivatives works thereof, to use, have used,
import, make, have made, sell, offer to sell, sublicense (through multiple
tiers of sublicensees), distribute (through multiple tiers of distributors)
such derivative work(s) on a stand-alone basis or as incorporated into the
Licensed Materials or other related technologies.  For the sake of clarity,
NVIDIA is not prohibited or otherwise restricted from independently developing
new features or functionality with respect to the Licensed Materials

No Other License:No rights or licenses with respect to any proprietary
information or patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property
right owned or controlled by NVIDIA are granted by NVIDIA to Licensee under
this Agreement, expressly or by implication, except as expressly provided in
this Agreement. 

Confidentiality: If applicable, any exchange of Confidential Information (as
defined in the NDA) shall be made pursuant to the terms and conditions of a
separately signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (“NDA”) by and between NVIDIA and
You. For the sake of clarity, You agree that (a) the Software (in source code
form); and (b) Your use of the Software is considered Confidential Information
of NVIDIA.

If You wish to have a third party consultant or subcontractor ("Contractor")
perform work on Your behalf which involves access to or use of Software, You
shall obtain a written confidentiality agreement from the Contractor which
contains terms and obligations with respect to access to or use of Software no
less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement and excluding any
distribution or sublicense rights, and use for any other purpose than permitted
in this Agreement. Otherwise, You shall not disclose the terms or existence of
this Agreement or use NVIDIA's name in any publications, advertisements, or
other announcements without NVIDIA's prior written consent.  Unless otherwise
provided in this Agreement, You do not have any rights to use any NVIDIA
trademarks or logos.

Intellectual Property Ownership: Except as expressly licensed to Licensee under
this Agreement, NVIDIA reserves all right, title and interest, including but
not limited to all intellectual property rights, in and to the Licensed
Materials and any derivative work(s) made thereto. The algorithms, structure,
organization and Source Code are the valuable trade secrets and confidential
information of NVIDIA.

Licensee acknowledges and agrees that it is Licensee’s sole responsibility to
obtain any, additional, third party licenses required to make, have made, use,
have used, sell, import, and offer for sale Licensee products that include or
incorporate any third party technology such as operating systems, audio and/or
video encoders and decoders or any technology from, including but not limited
to, Microsoft, Thomson, Fraunhofer IIS, Sisvel S.p.A., MPEG-LA, and Coding
Technologies (“Third Party Technology”).  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that
NVIDIA has not granted to Licensee under this Agreement any necessary patent
rights with respect to the Third Party Technology.  As such, Licensee’s use of
the Third Party Technology may be subject to further restrictions and terms and
conditions.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Licensee is solely and
exclusively responsible for obtaining any and all authorizations and licenses
required for the use, distribution and/or incorporation of the Third Party
Technology.

Licensee shall, at its own expense fully indemnify, hold harmless, defend
and/or settle any claim, suit or proceeding that is asserted by a third party
against NVIDIA and its officers, employees or agents, to the extent such claim,
suit or proceeding arising from or related to Licensee’s failure to fully
satisfy and/or comply with the third party licensing obligations related to the
Third Party Technology (a “Claim”).  In the event of a Claim, Licensee agrees
to: (a) pay all damages or settlement amounts, which shall not be finalized
without the prior written consent of NVIDIA, (including other reasonable costs
incurred by NVIDIA, including reasonable attorneys fees, in connection with
enforcing this paragraph); (b) reimburse NVIDIA for any licensing fees and/or
penalties incurred by NVIDIA in connection with a Claim; and (c) immediately
procure/satisfy the third party licensing obligations before using the Software
pursuant to this Agreement.

Term of Agreement:  This Agreement shall become effective from the date of the
initial download and shall remain in effect for one year thereafter, unless
terminated as provided below.  Unless either party notifies the other party of
its intent to terminate this Agreement at least thirty (30) days prior to the
end of the Initial Term or the applicable renewal period, this Agreement will
be automatically renewed for one (1) year renewal periods thereafter, unless
