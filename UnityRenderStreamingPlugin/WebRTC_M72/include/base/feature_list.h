// The FeatureList class is used to determine whether a given feature is on or
// off. It provides an authoritative answer, taking into account command-line
// overrides and experimental control.
//
// The basic use case is for any feature that can be toggled (e.g. through
// command-line or an experiment) to have a defined Feature struct, e.g.:
//
//   const base::Feature kMyGreatFeature {
//     "MyGreatFeature", base::FEATURE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT
//   };
//
// Then, client code that wishes to query the state of the feature would check:
//
//   if (base::FeatureList::IsEnabled(kMyGreatFeature)) {
//     // Feature code goes here.
//   }
//
// Behind the scenes, the above call would take into account any command-line
// flags to enable or disable the feature, any experiments that may control it
// and finally its default state (in that order of priority), to determine
// whether the feature is on.
//
// Features can be explicitly forced on or off by specifying a list of comma-
// separated feature names via the following command-line flags:
//
//   --enable-features=Feature5,Feature7
//   --disable-features=Feature1,Feature2,Feature3
//
// To enable/disable features in a test, do NOT append --enable-features or
// --disable-features to the command-line directly. Instead, use
// ScopedFeatureList. See base/test/scoped_feature_list.h for details.
//
// After initialization (which should be done single-threaded), the FeatureList
// API is thread safe.
//
// Note: This class is a singleton, but does not use base/memory/singleton.h in
// order to have control over its initialization sequence. Specifically, the
// intended use is to create an instance of this class and fully initialize it,
// before setting it as the singleton for a process, via SetInstance().
