// FieldTrial is a class for handling details of statistical experiments
// performed by actual users in the field (i.e., in a shipped or beta product).
// All code is called exclusively on the UI thread currently.
//
// The simplest example is an experiment to see whether one of two options
// produces "better" results across our user population.  In that scenario, UMA
// data is uploaded to aggregate the test results, and this FieldTrial class
// manages the state of each such experiment (state == which option was
// pseudo-randomly selected).
//
// States are typically generated randomly, either based on a one time
// randomization (which will yield the same results, in terms of selecting
// the client for a field trial or not, for every run of the program on a
// given machine), or by a session randomization (generated each time the
// application starts up, but held constant during the duration of the
// process).

//------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Example:  Suppose we have an experiment involving memory, such as determining
// the impact of some pruning algorithm.
// We assume that we already have a histogram of memory usage, such as:

//   UMA_HISTOGRAM_COUNTS_1M("Memory.RendererTotal", count);

// Somewhere in main thread initialization code, we'd probably define an
// instance of a FieldTrial, with code such as:

// // FieldTrials are reference counted, and persist automagically until
// // process teardown, courtesy of their automatic registration in
// // FieldTrialList.
// // Note: This field trial will run in Chrome instances compiled through
// //       8 July, 2015, and after that all instances will be in "StandardMem".
// scoped_refptr<base::FieldTrial> trial(
//     base::FieldTrialList::FactoryGetFieldTrial(
//         "MemoryExperiment", 1000, "StandardMem", 2015, 7, 8,
//         base::FieldTrial::ONE_TIME_RANDOMIZED, NULL));
//
// const int high_mem_group =
//     trial->AppendGroup("HighMem", 20);  // 2% in HighMem group.
// const int low_mem_group =
//     trial->AppendGroup("LowMem", 20);   // 2% in LowMem group.
// // Take action depending of which group we randomly land in.
// if (trial->group() == high_mem_group)
//   SetPruningAlgorithm(kType1);  // Sample setting of browser state.
// else if (trial->group() == low_mem_group)
//   SetPruningAlgorithm(kType2);  // Sample alternate setting.
