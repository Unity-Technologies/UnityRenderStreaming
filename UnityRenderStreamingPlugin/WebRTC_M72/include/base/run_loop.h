// Helper class to run the RunLoop::Delegate associated with the current thread.
// A RunLoop::Delegate must have been bound to this thread (ref.
// RunLoop::RegisterDelegateForCurrentThread()) prior to using any of RunLoop's
// member and static methods unless explicitly indicated otherwise (e.g.
// IsRunning/IsNestedOnCurrentThread()). RunLoop::Run can only be called once
// per RunLoop lifetime. Create a RunLoop on the stack and call Run/Quit to run
// a nested RunLoop but please do not use nested loops in production code!
class BASE_EXPORT RunLoop {
 public:
  // The type of RunLoop: a kDefault RunLoop at the top-level (non-nested) will
  // process system and application tasks assigned to its Delegate. When nested
  // however a kDefault RunLoop will only process system tasks while a
  // kNestableTasksAllowed RunLoop will continue to process application tasks
  // even if nested.
  //
  // This is relevant in the case of recursive RunLoops. Some unwanted run loops
  // may occur when using common controls or printer functions. By default,
  // recursive task processing is disabled.
  //
  // In general, nestable RunLoops are to be avoided. They are dangerous and
  // difficult to get right, so please use with extreme caution.
  //
  // A specific example where this makes a difference is:
  // - The thread is running a RunLoop.
  // - It receives a task #1 and executes it.
  // - The task #1 implicitly starts a RunLoop, like a MessageBox in the unit
  //   test. This can also be StartDoc or GetSaveFileName.
  // - The thread receives a task #2 before or while in this second RunLoop.
  // - With a kNestableTasksAllowed RunLoop, the task #2 will run right away.
  //   Otherwise, it will get executed right after task #1 completes in the main
  //   RunLoop.

  // RunLoop has already finished running has no effect.
