// A sparse bitmap of heap addresses where the (very few) addresses that are
// set are likely to be in small clusters. The abstraction is tailored to
// support heap compaction, assuming the following:
//
//   - Addresses will be bitmap-marked from lower to higher addresses.
//   - Bitmap lookups are performed for each object that is compacted
//     and moved to some new location, supplying the (base, size)
//     pair of the object's heap allocation.
//   - If the sparse bitmap has any marked addresses in that range, it
//     returns a sub-bitmap that can be quickly iterated over to check which
//     addresses within the range are actually set.
//   - The bitmap is needed to support something that is very rarely done
//     by the current Blink codebase, which is to have nested collection
//     part objects. Consequently, it is safe to assume sparseness.
//
// Support the above by having a sparse bitmap organized as a binary
// tree with nodes covering fixed size ranges via a simple bitmap/set.
// That is, each SparseHeapBitmap node will contain a bitmap/set for
// some fixed size range, along with pointers to SparseHeapBitmaps
// for addresses on each side its range.
//
// This bitmap tree isn't kept balanced across the Address additions
// made.
