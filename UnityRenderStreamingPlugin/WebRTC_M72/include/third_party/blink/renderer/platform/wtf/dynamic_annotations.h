/* This file defines dynamic annotations for use with dynamic analysis
 * tool such as ThreadSanitizer, Valgrind, etc.
 *
 * Dynamic annotation is a source code annotation that affects
 * the generated code (that is, the annotation is not a comment).
 * Each such annotation is attached to a particular
 * instruction and/or to a particular object (address) in the program.
 *
 * By using dynamic annotations a developer can give more details to the dynamic
 * analysis tool to improve its precision.
 *
 * In C/C++ program the annotations are represented as C macros.
 * With the default build flags, these macros are empty, hence don't affect
 * performance of a compiled binary.
 * If dynamic annotations are enabled, they just call no-op functions.
 * The dynamic analysis tools can intercept these functions and replace them
 * with their own implementations.
 *
 * See http://code.google.com/p/data-race-test/wiki/DynamicAnnotations for more
 * information.
