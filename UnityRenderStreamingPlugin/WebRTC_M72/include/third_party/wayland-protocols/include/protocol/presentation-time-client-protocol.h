	 * clock_gettime(). clock_gettime() is defined by POSIX.1-2001.
	 *
	 * Timestamps in this clock domain are expressed as tv_sec_hi,

	 * 32-bit value. Whole seconds are in tv_sec which is a 64-bit

	 * Note that clock_id applies only to the presentation clock, and
	 * implies nothing about e.g. the timestamps used in the Wayland
	 * core protocol input events.

	 * Compositors should prefer a clock which does not jump and is not

 *
 * VSYNC:

 * The display hardware provided measurements that the hardware
 * driver converted into a presentation timestamp. Sampling a
 * clock in user space is not acceptable for this flag.
 *
 * HW_COMPLETION:
 * The display hardware signalled that it started using the new
 * image content. The opposite of this is e.g. a timer being used
 * to guess when the display hardware has switched to the new
 * image content.
 *
 * ZERO_COPY:

	 * future refreshes, i.e., estimating the timestamps targeting the
	 * next few vblanks. If such prediction cannot usefully be done,

	 * the output's vertical retrace counter when the content update
	 * was first scanned out to the display. This value must be
	 * compatible with the definition of MSC in GLX_OML_sync_control
	 * specification. Note, that if the display path has a non-zero
	 * latency, the time instant specified by this counter may differ
