// This is the crazy linker, a custom dynamic linker that can be used
// by NDK applications to load shared libraries (not executables) with
// a twist.
//
// Compared to the dynamic linker, the crazy one has the following
// features:
//
//   - It can use an arbitrary search path.
//
//   - It can load a library at a memory fixed address.
//
//   - It can load libraries from zip archives (as long as they are
//     page aligned and uncompressed). Even when running on pre-Android M
//     systems.
//
//   - It can share the RELRO section between two libraries
//     loaded at the same address in two distinct processes.
