//! \brief An exception handler that writes crash reports for exception messages
//!     to a CrashReportDatabase.
class CrashReportExceptionHandler {
 public:
  //! \brief Creates a new object that will store crash reports in \a database.
  //!
  //! \param[in] database The database to store crash reports in. Weak.
  //! \param[in] upload_thread The upload thread to notify when a new crash
  //!     report is written into \a database.
  //! \param[in] process_annotations A map of annotations to insert as
  //!     process-level annotations into each crash report that is written. Do
  //!     not confuse this with module-level annotations, which are under the
  //!     control of the crashing process, and are used to implement Chrome's
  //!     "crash keys." Process-level annotations are those that are beyond the
  //!     control of the crashing process, which must reliably be set even if
  //!     the process crashes before itâ€™s able to establish its own annotations.
  //!     To interoperate with Breakpad servers, the recommended practice is to
  //!     specify values for the `"prod"` and `"ver"` keys as process
  //!     annotations.
  //! \param[in] process_attachments A map of file name keys to file paths to be
  //!     included in the report. Each time a report is written, the file paths
  //!     will be read in their entirety and included in the report using the
  //!     file name key as the name in the http upload.
  //! \param[in] user_stream_data_sources Data sources to be used to extend
  //!     crash reports. For each crash report that is written, the data sources
  //!     are called in turn. These data sources may contribute additional
  //!     minidump streams. `nullptr` if not required.
