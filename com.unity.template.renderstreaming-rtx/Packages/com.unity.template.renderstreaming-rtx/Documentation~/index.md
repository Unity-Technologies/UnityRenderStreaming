# Unity Render Streaming Raytracing template

**Unity Render Streaming** is a solution that provides Unity's high definition rendering abilities via browser. It's designed to meet the needs of tasks like viewing car configurators or architectural models on mobile devices.  

This solution's streaming technology takes advantage of [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/),  and through customization developers can create their own unique solutions.

### Hardware encoder

This solution is optimised for NVIDIA graphics cards. Using a recommended graphics card will allow streaming with lower latency. See NVIDIA's [NVIDIA VIDEO CODEC SDK](https://developer.nvidia.com/video-encode-decode-gpu-support-matrix) webpage for a list of recommended graphics cards.
